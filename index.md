# Open Protocol Overview

The Open Protocol project enables seamless integration between AI systems and data sources using a standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture. This framework creates secure, bidirectional connections that enhance AI/LLM capabilities through structured context-sharing.

| Component                   | Description                                          | Key Features                                      | Integration Path                                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Core Protocol**           | Foundation layer for AI/data connections             | Universal connectors; security-first design        | Direct implementation or via SDK                   |
| **Context Engine**          | Real-time context management system                  | Dynamic context windows; state preservation        | API integration with context-aware applications    |
| **Workflow Automation**     | Process automation with AI decision support          | Low-code workflows; conditional branching          | Deploy workflow templates in existing systems      |
| **Data Connectors**         | Pre-built integration points for common data sources | Cross-source federation; automatic schema mapping  | Plug-and-play with supported systems               |
| **Governance Framework**    | Compliance and access control layer                  | Audit trails; role-based permissions               | Deploy alongside core components                   |

> *Tip: Open Protocol components can be deployed individually or as a complete stack, based on your integration needs.*

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   Ensure you have SSH keys set up for GitHub. If you don't, use the HTTPS URL below.
   ```bash
   # Using SSH (preferred)
   git clone git@github.com:groupthinking/Open_Pro.git
   # Or, using HTTPS (fallback)
   git clone https://github.com/groupthinking/Open_Pro.git
   cd Open_Pro
   ```

2. **Review the component documentation** above.

3. **Explore integration paths** for your specific use cases.
