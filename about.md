# About Open Protocol

## Our Mission

Open Protocol is designed to create a universal standard for connecting AI systems with data sources and applications. We enable frictionless, secure data exchange that enhances AI capabilities while maintaining proper governance and control.

Our core mission is to:

- Build open standards for AI-data integration
- Enable secure, bidirectional context sharing
- Create a thriving ecosystem of compatible tools and systems
- Ensure AI systems can reliably access and utilize relevant context

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

At the heart of Open Protocol is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which builds secure, two-way connections between external data sources and AI/LLM systems, enabling structured, seamless context-sharing for smart, dynamic workflows.

### Why MCP Matters

MCP functions like USB-C for AI systems:

- Creates standardized connections between any data source and AI system
- Enables secure, controlled information sharing with proper permissions
- Supports dynamic workflows with real-time context updates
- Prevents information siloing and reduces data leakage risks

## Project Roadmap

The Open Protocol project is evolving through several key phases:

1. **Foundation Phase (Current):** Core protocol specification and reference implementations
2. **Ecosystem Phase:** Expanding integrations and building developer tools
3. **Adoption Phase:** Enterprise deployment patterns and advanced use cases
4. **Standards Phase:** Formal standardization and industry-wide adoption
